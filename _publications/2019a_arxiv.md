title: "New Solutions to the Reflection Equation with Braces"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019a_arxiv
excerpt: 'The reflection equation of Cherednik is a counterpart to the celebrated Yang-Baxter equation, with importance in the theory of integrable systems. We obtain several new solutions of the reflection equation using braces building on the work of Smoktunowicz, Vendramin and Weston.'
