The reflection equation of Cherednik is a counterpart to the celebrated Yang-Baxter equation, with importance in the theory of integrable systems. We obtain several new solutions of the reflection equation using braces building on the work of Smoktunowicz, Vendramin and Weston. In particular, we show that every brace yields several simple solutions and that a natural class of solutions is a near-ring. We find more solutions for factorizable rings. Some of our solutions apply to the original parameter-dependent equation.
