I am a final-year PhD student at University College London.
My research interests are extremal and probabilistic combinatorics.

I completed my undergraduate and master's studies at the University of Edinburgh. 
Following this, I was awarded a Distinction for my MSc in Mathematics and Foundations of Computer Science from the University of Oxford.
Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Data Scientist at Actelligent Capital and continued part-time during my PhD.
